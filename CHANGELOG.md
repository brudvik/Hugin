### Fixed
- **Channel JOIN messages not reaching joining user**: Fixed critical bug where users would not receive their own JOIN message and subsequent channel messages. The `MessageBroker.SendToChannelAsync` method now uses `IChannelRepository` to look up channel members from the authoritative `Channel.Members` collection instead of a separate (and unsynchronized) connection tracking dictionary in `ConnectionManager`. This ensures IRC clients like mIRC properly display channels after joining.
- **CAP negotiation breaking automatic registration**: Fixed bug where IRC clients using IRCv3 capability negotiation (like mIRC) would hang after connecting. The `CAP END` handler now correctly checks if NICK and USER were received during negotiation and sets the appropriate registration state to allow registration to complete.
- **Line parsing error with multi-segment buffers**: Fixed `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in `ClientConnection.TryReadLine` when reading IRC lines that span multiple buffer segments. Now uses `PositionOf` and proper sequence slicing instead of `SequenceReader.TryReadTo`.
- **Database migration check**: `SetupController.TestDatabaseConnectionAsync` now checks `__EFMigrationsHistory` table instead of just table count

### Changed
- **JsonSerializerOptions caching**: All JSON serialization now uses cached `JsonSerializerOptions` instances to avoid CA1869 warnings and improve performance
  - `JwtJsonOptions`: Cached options for admin user serialization
  - `ConfigJsonOptions`: Cached options for configuration file serialization  
  - `OperatorJsonOptions`: Cached options for operator config serialization
- **Culture-invariant string operations**: All string comparisons now use `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` or `ToUpperInvariant()` to avoid culture-dependent behavior (CA1304/CA1311/CA1862)
- **Null-safe S2S routing**: `ConnectionManager.SendToServerAsync` now uses null-conditional operators for `RemoteServerId` access
